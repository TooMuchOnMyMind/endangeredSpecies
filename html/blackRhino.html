        <h2>FACTS:</h2>
        <h3>The black rhinoceros, also known as the hook-lipped rhinoceros, is one of the most iconic animals in Africa. Black rhinos are browsers, meaning they feed on bushes and trees rather than grass. They have a pointed upper lip that helps them grab twigs and leaves from shrubs and trees. Unlike white rhinos, which are grazers, black rhinos are smaller and more agile. Black rhinos have two horns, with the front horn being the longest, averaging around 19 inches long. These horns continue to grow throughout the rhino's life, similar to human fingernails.</h3>

        <h3>Historically, black rhinos roamed across much of sub-Saharan Africa, but their population has drastically declined due to poaching for their horns and habitat loss. Between 1960 and 1995, the black rhino population dropped by 98%, leaving fewer than 2,500 individuals in the wild. However, through concerted conservation efforts, the black rhino population has made a comeback, with more than 6,000 rhinos now living in the wild.</h3>

        <h3>The black rhino is still considered critically endangered, with ongoing threats from poaching, loss of habitat, and human-wildlife conflict. Despite these challenges, there is hope, as conservation initiatives continue to improve the situation for this magnificent species.</h3>

        <h3>Conservation Status: Critically Endangered</h3>

        <h3>Black rhinos are found in several regions of Africa, including Namibia, Southwest Indian Ocean, and the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA). Conservation efforts have seen positive impacts, but continued efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of the species.</h3>
